                <h3>The Unexpected Guest</h3>

                <p>One hot late summer's eve in an average village outside average metropolis the sunset was seen [by far]. Skyler stared at the horizon from an average pretty-rugged hammock.
                With a pretty-smoking [butt] resting on ones [bottom] nothing could be lesser at stake today, Skyler thought. „Skyler! The world is at stake while smoking your [butt] off“, 
                a squeaky voice shouted from the roof of one's house. Skyler had to [swallow] and coughed, blinking up the roof coughing and shouting at the disturbing [swallow]. „I am a robin 
                and you should stop to [swallow]“ the misinterpreted [swallow] claimed vigorously.</p>

                <p>What by a medium-rare [steak] bloody business would a talking robin have atop of one's roof, Skyler thought in an instant. „The world is at [stake] and you, Skyler, are acquired“, 
                    the robin filled in „and take a cigarette or more, a banana, a towel and a stone with you - we are leaving soon, Time works against us here.“ Totally [surprised] by the [stunning] bird, 
                    Skyler went into the house, picked some tobacco, a banana, a towel and a stone from outside. Sheer curiosity seemed to move Skyler's body, standing outside staring at the little red and 
                    brown bird now. „Mind control made me made you collect your stuff. According to the record, your company is by far a stunning approach. My name is Robin and we will take a little [turn] 
                    in just a moment“ the robin said and landed on Skyler's shoulder when the world began to [twist] around the hummingbird.</p>

                <h3>Outta Space</h3>

                <p>„Bird, I don't feel [comfortable]“ Skyler gasped while looking around the new [site]. The bird claimed its name was Robin and it did not appreciate ignorant behaviour. „[Well], we have 
                landed on Eden in a stable orbit around earth right for [supper]…“ the bird started, but was rudely interrupted „don't tell me bollocks, what Maniac Mansion [place] is this!?“ „Silence“ 
                Robin squeaked and Skyler was not able to get another word out. Mind control again? Distracting thoughts and the awareness of missing cloth were very disturbing. „You should use your towel, 
                transfer-warping is often resulting in a loss of cloth, except towels and rare artefacts “, the bird added „and no worries - you are not part of the [buffet].“ Skyler was advised to step 
                into a shower-cabin-like box while memorising cloth and walked out fully redressed. This thought-control thing was getting handy.</p>

                <p>„Gosh“ Skyler shouted, „I have never done such a [difficult] job.“</p>

                <p>„Stop [nagging] yourself around in past [tense] and look at the bright side, you have your artefacts as an advantage! Cigarettes for a proper disguise, a banana off the [spike] of a plant 
                to fuel EVE, and a hard rock from Earth that chef Scrap would [stalk] his mother for. Would you now please [grab] the banana and put it inside the box.“ Robin instructed. The assumption 
                „You better stop [criticizing], and why should I throw the banana into the wardrobe?“ was simply answered with the word „Multi-device“, you humans should try that sometime - safes resources. 
                It magically worked, but don't [take] the trouble home. Dried banana stain is [hard] to come by.</p>

                <p>The S.T.A.R. ship EDEN started [vibrating], and out of a sudden everything began to move without moving and burst into glaring bokeh.
                    „To be [fair], we'll be right for teatime“ Robin tweeted happily - and as the sparkling slowly faded, a big screen in front of them revealed a big shiny object that looked more like a big 
                    [humming] [amusement park] the closer they came. „Welcome to Scrap's Kitchen, the least, but most [busy] and tasty place to be in the universe…“ Robin spoke out in riddles.</p>

                <h3>Infiltration</h3>

                <p>Quick, hide the artefacts - wrap them into your towel. We will be scanned by the [gate] keeper, and have to hide everything until we are cleared and entering our [bay]. 
                Said and done - Skyler stared at the screen until the big digital [light] on the screen turned from red to green. "Careful now, we can not take this too [easy]", until then nobody would 
                have expected the robin to be able to speak with such soft [sound]. "Light up a cigarette, it will disguise you at this place as long as the scents of smoke [rest] on you. Humans are merely 
                invited to serve as dinner at this place - mostly without any [leftover]." Skyler was relieved and smoking a butt - the level of stress immediately started to drop. "Such an addict..." 
                Robin whispered inside Skyler's head who cognitively answered to "get out, I slowly doubt being [fair]-minded!" Shortly after the humming ship stopped and the engines turned off. Silence 
                - and the feeling of hearing one's heartbeat rushing through one's ears. The big [hatch] opened and the two companions mingled with the crowds unnoticed. It was time to [scheme] a plot.</p>
