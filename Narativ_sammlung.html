<h2>Act 1 - Setting The Course</h2>ACT 1

<h2>The Unexpected Guest</h2>

    <p>One hot late summer's eve in an average village outside average metropolis the sunset was seen [by far]. 
        Skyler stared at the horizon from an average pretty-rugged hammock. With a pretty-smoking [butt] resting on ones 
        [bottom] nothing could be lesser at stake today, Skyler thought. „Skyler! The world is at stake while smoking your [butt] off.“ 
        a squeaky voice shouted from the roof of ones house. Skyler had to [swallow] and coughed, blinking up the roof 
        coughing and shouting at the disturbing [swallow]. „I'am a robin and you should stop to [swallow]“ the misinterpreted [swallow] 
        claimed vigorously.</p>

    <p>What by a medium-rare [steak] bloody business would a talking robin have atop of ones roof, Skyler thought in an instant. 
        „The world is at [stake] and you, Skyler, are acquired“, the robin filled in „and take a cigarette or more, a banana, a towel 
        and a stone with you - we are leaving soon, Time works against us here.“ Totally [surprised] by the [stunning] bird, Skyler went into 
        the house, picked some tobacco, a banana, a towel and a stone from outside. Sheer curiosity seemed to move Skylers body, standing outside
        staring at the little red and brown bird now. „Mind control made me made you collecting your stuff. According to record your company is by far 
        a stunning approach. My name is Robin and we will take a little [turn] in just a moment“ the robin said and landed on Skylers shoulder 
        when the world began to [twist] around the humming bird.</p>

<h3>Outta Space</h3>

    <p>„Bird, I don't feel [comfortable]“ Skyler grasped while looking around the new [site]. The bird claimed its name was Robin 
        and it did not appreciate ignorant behavior. „[Well], we have landed on Eden in stable orbit around earth right for [supper]…“ 
        the bird started, but was rudely interrupted „don't tell me bollocks, what Maniac Mansion [place] is this!?“ „Silence“ Robin squeaked 
        and Skyler was not able to get another word out. Mind control again? Distracting thoughts and the awareness of missing cloth were very 
        disturbing. „You should use your towel, transfer-warping is often resulting in a loss of cloth, except towels and rare artifacts“, 
        the bird added „and no worries - you are not part of the [buffet].“ Skyler was advised to step into a shower-cabin like box while memorising 
        cloth and walked out fully redressed. This thought-control-thing was getting handy.</p>

    <p>„Welcome to EVE, the fastest and only S.T.A.R. (Space Time And Relativity) ship with a conscious, [long] story.“ 
        During dinner Skyler was filled in by Robin about the situation while having the most [tender] soy and peer-based vegan [steak] 
        one could [wish] for. The world at best if not the universe where at [stake], because an intergalactic chef „Scrap“ did learn 
        to manipulate the time [stream]. That individuum was creating multiple time strings to control every single one of his restaurants - the
        „[Soft] Rock Snacks“. Unfortunately one time string was planned on a route through Earth, which would result in a planetary [squash] 
        and [explosion]. More unfortunately the [incineration] of the planet would lead to the destruction of the [pumpkin] species, which is not 
        only rich in antioxidants. Moreover each [knob]-part of a pumpkin is holding a [knot] of the [space]-[time] which balances [time] and [space] 
        throughout the universe.</p>

    <p>„Gosh“ Skyler shouted, „I have never done such a [difficult] job.“</p>

    <p>„Stop [nagging] yourself around in past [tense] and look at the bright side, you have your artifacts as advantage! 
        Cigarettes for a proper disguise, a banana off the [spike] of a plant to fuel EVE, and a hard rock from Earth that chef Scrap 
        would [stalk] his mother for. Would you now please [grab] the banana and put it inside the box.“ Robin instructed. The assumtion
        „You better stop [criticizing], and why should I throw the banana into the wardrobe?“ was simply answered with the word „Multi-device“, 
        you humans should try that sometime - safes resources. It magically worked, but don't [take] the trouble home - dried banana stain is [hard] 
        to come by.</p>

    <p>The S.T.A.R. ship EDEN started [vibrating], and out of a sudden everything began to move without moving and burst into glaring bokeh.</p>

    <p>„To be [fair], we'll be right for teatime“ Robin tweeted happily - and as the sparkling slowly faded, a big screen in front of them reveled 
        a big shiny object that looked more like a big [humming] [amusement park] the closer they came. „Welcome to Scrap's Kitchen, the least, 
        but most [busy] and tasty place to be in the universe…“  Robin spoke out in riddles.</p>

<h3>Infiltration</h3>
    
    <p>Quick, hide the artifacts - wrap them into your towel. We will be scanned by the [gate] keeper, and have to hide everything until we are cleared and entering our [bay].
        Said and done - Skyler stared at the screen until the big digital [light] on the screen turned from red to green. "Careful now, we can not take this too [easy]", 
        until then nobody would have expected the robin being able to speak with such soft [sound]. "Light up a cigarette, it will disguise you at this place as long as 
        the scents of smoke [rest] on you. Humans are merely invited to serve as dinner at this place - mostly without any [leftover]." Skyler was relieved and smoking a butt - 
        the level of stress immediately started to drop. "Such an addict..." Robin whispered inside Skylers head who cognitively answered to "get out, I slowly doubt being [fair]-minded!"
        Shortly after the humming ship stopped and the engines turned off. Silence - and the feeling to hearing ones heartbeat rushing through ones ears.
        The big [hatch] opened and the two companions mingled with the crowds unnoticed. It was time to [scheme] a plot.</p>   

<h2>Act 2 - Confrontation</h2>

<h3>Harbinger of doom</h3><!-- ReRead! -->

    <p>Though Skyler was wondering a bit about the adventure, one found oneself in lately, there was no doubt about the plan. Also Robin seemed unshakabe as the two paved their way
        through the streets of Scrap's Kitchen. Indeed there was no odd feeling [after] all. Skyler lid another cigarette.
        "You two are adorable, Robin, are you?" a piercing voice echoed, that seemed to come from [behind] and everywhere at once... "Did you [trick] your new friend with the fairy tale 
        of the towel again? Delightful! Poor [kid]-number... I forgot counting." A flashlight appeared out of a sudden. Together with a high pitch [tone] and the feeling being elevated and dropped
        through a [gate] of light. That was everything noticable within the blink of an eye. Landing on ones [bottom] - except the flying bird. Skyler kept sitting nousously at the spot, literally feeling
        the [colour] fading off ones face.</p>
    <p>"Excuse my theatrical [entrance], but the kids in our days are not so easily [impressed] anymore" a voice from a computer panel said. "My name is Barney Sqabble, and I am a chef.
        In fact I would still be the greatest chef of all time, if it was not for your bird-friend. My friends call me Scrappy, because that's what [left] of me inside this quantum-computer.",
        the voice added. "Did you bring the final ingredient, old friend?" the computer voice of Scrappy echoed and Robin answered. "The heartstone from earth is [marked] by the human;
        unwrap the stone, boy" Skyler noted the robins alarmingly harsh tone. "I'am a girl you [quack] of a swallow, and when I am finished with you - you will look more like a [quack]-a-duck
         - on fire!" Suddenly, Skyler was furious, that was [not right]! She could finally [plug] out of her everydays' boredom, and at the first chance she got betrayed [ending] up into some kind of intergalactic
        cooking-shit-show. Gosh, Skyler hated that [imposter] and was ready to [work] her way to bring that robin down. "Silence" the bird shouted within her head "whitness [perfection]!".
        Skyler was not able to resist, and felt like [performing her final act] by the mercy of Robin and the Super-Computer.</p>

    
 <h3>Salvation</h3>

    <p>"Rise, child" a soft unknown voice added, and the echo of Robin's words was gone. "Rise and do as you are pleased" it was a slightly faded but [friendly] voice that now [absolutely] filled
        Skylers mind. "[Prepare] the heartstone and bring it to the console" the computervoice demanded. "Take out your stone and walk to the console" the kind voice added. Skyler did as she was pleased.
        A slot opened and a [perfectly] shiny but [pale-coloured] crystal ring appeared and Skyler was ordered to [lay] the stone form earth into the ring. Slowly her hand reached towards the console.</p>
        
    <p>"Notice the [light] ball on your left hand side: [steal] the ring and touch the light - imagine being on the spaceship. I will fire up and be waiting for you." the voice faded.
        Skyler took new [courage], her hand stopped hovering the earthstone atop the crystal. "Do it!" Robin demanded. "Do you want to know what I love about [thought]-[control]? Never [mind]..." 
        Out of a sudden Skyler [grasped] for the crystal with her other hand, and longed with both hands for the light ball [forcing] a picture of the spaceships interior into her memory.<br>
        Irritated by the glacing light and the ringing in her ears, she did not notice the angry screams and raging of her abductors when she landed on her feet right in the control room of
        S.T.A.R. ship EVE. "Hey, you are becoming expert in [transporting]. Hello my name is Eve, and I welcome you aboard of - well - me." the soft voice said. "Pardon me!" Skyler shouted surprised.
        "I am your today's [travel] guide and time for an explaination will be later - in fact all of time. Please insert my candy-gum ring back into the time-drive", the voice asked kindly.
        "That is candy?" "Sure, you can try." Skyler gave the crystal al [lick] in disbelief "Sweet woodruff" she shouted "my favourite" the computer added in one voice with the smiling girl.
        It was a good [bargin] after all and the day just got slightly [coated] in pink. 
        Red lights and disturbing alarm bells where [crashing] the moment. "Rush now earthchild, to the time-drive and let me work some magic."
        Skyler placed the candy-ring into a small opening on the main console that seemed to be [made] for it.</p>
    <p>Acompanied by a humming sound, all the the ships lights lightened up at once. The big screen turned on and revealed a "big [closing] spacedoor we will [collide] with!" Skyler shouted. "Time until hangar closing 15 clicks...
        how good can you throw, Skyler? We are still linked, and home is sometimes not further away than a stone-throw... bed's are [prepared]" Hertbeat "10... Throw your 9... heartstone 8... and think 7... you clever girl 6... 
        and remeber 5... Heartbeat 4... Skyler threw the stone towards the screen with closed eyes with a single [thought] "let's [finish] this and go home". It felt like time and space got stretched, 
        as Eve fired the time-drive within Skylers [reflection].</p>

<h2>Act 3 - Redemption</h2>

<h3>The road less taken</h3>

    <p>Several hours had passed since Skyler and Eve did arrive Earth, while the S.T.A.R ship was circling around the planet. Eve was explaining everything to a very curious Skyler, with a good cup of tea.
        The origin and whereabouts of of the dark chef Scrappy and Robin, Eves capture and theft of her candy-ring which was nessecary for time travel, and misused by the two thugs in Scrap's kitchen.
        Who just did develop an insatiable hunger for rare artifacts to use as ingredients for their evil-freakish plan: controlling space-time. "Don't you worry girl, without the crystal it will take them
        ages to follow me." Eve ended. "You mean us. Those type of guys will never stop, will they." Skyler asked contemplatively. "No. But it will be a dagerous path, and thrilling." the artificial intelligence
        answered. "Then I should pick up some stones..." the kid answered. "And stop smoking. Really! That doesn't suit a time traveller" Eve expanded.
        The sunset on a late summer's eve was dazzling, causing the chromatic shine of the time travellers' ship leaving a small average village stay unnoticed.
